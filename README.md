This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 3.2.1
* Client side - React.js and Tailwind css

* System dependencies
     - mechanize gem (https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize)
     - npm modules
     - vite react app

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
     - While Sidekiq isn't currently implemented, its integration could be valuable for future enhancements.
